# Table Definitions

|Table|Details|
|--|--|
|`all_attempts`|Every single attempt ever recorded has its own entry in this table, except DNSes.|
|`championship_podiums`|List of results resulting in a National, Continental or World Podium for the competitor (ty Oliver Wheat)|
|`concise_results` and `pbs`, `competition_pbs`|Calculates whether or not a result was a PB. `concise_results` then lists all results, with a `PB` boolean field. `pbs` contains only the results from `concise_results` that are PBs. `conmpetition_pbs` counts the number of PBs set by a competitor at every competition, and also includes a version excluding FMC-only competitions for the purposes of `pb_streak`|
|`kinch`|Creates separate `kinch_country`, `kinch_continent` and `kinch_world` tables which calculate a competitors kinchrank for all regions, averaged over all events, in addition to the kinchrank for each event. Kinchranks were explained by Daniel Sheppard [here](http://www.kinch2002.com/kinchranks/)|
|`mbld_decoded`|'Decodes' all individual MBLD results in the database to give `points`, `attempted`, `missed`, `solved` and `seconds`. This way they can easily be read|
|`pb_streak`|Calculates streaks of competitions with a PB set. Also includes a version excluding FMC-only competitions|
|`persons_extra`|Creates a clone of the WCA's `persons` table, with many other statistics about each person. These include: `competitions` (competed at), `eventsAttempted`, `eventsSucceeded`, `eventsAverage`, `finals`, `podiums`, `gold`, `silver`, `bronze`, `eventsPodiumed`, `eventsWon`, `wcPodium`, `wChampion`, `records`, `WRs`, `CRs`, `NRs`, `countries` (competed in), `continents` (competed in), `multipleCountryComps` (e.g. FMC Europe), `distinctMultipleCountryComps` (number of competitions matching previous criteria), `completedSolves`, `DNFs`, a count of all podiums, golds, silvers, and bronzes from a world `wc`, continental `con` or national `nat` championship, `sorAverage`, `sorSingle`, `sorCombined`, KinchRanks based on `world`, `continent` and `country`, `minWorldRank` (currently) `maxPBStreak`, `currentPBStreak`, `membership` (as explained [here](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/all-wca-events-completion-club.39896/)), `firstComp`, `previousComp`, `upcomingComps`, `upcomingCompsAccepted`, `nextComp` (previous 3 only counting competitions using WCA registration), `delegate_status`, (and if they're a delegate - `region`, `location`, `competitionsDelegated` `competitionsDelegating` [i.e. upcoming comps]), `competitionsOrganized` `competitionsOrganizing`, and `wcaTeam`. Massive credit to Oliver Wheat who wrote the original sql file for this, which I have adapted since|
|`podiums`|List of results resulting in a regular podium for the the competitor|
|`records`|All the results from `result_dates` where a record was set|
|`registrations_extra`|A clone of the WCA's `registrations` table, but with personIds and names, as well as the events the competitor has signed up for.|
|`relays`|These tables sum a competitors single times and outputs the expected time for the relay. `allEvents` is everything except FMC and MBLD, as these can't really be added alongside the others. `guildford` and `miniGuildford` relays were explained [here](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/guildford-challenge-in-5-20-28-3-man-team.39891/) by Robert Yau, Daniel Sheppard and James Molloy back in 2013|
|`result_dates`|A near-clone of the original WCA `results` table, but with added fields for `weekend` (the period of time beginning on the Thursday before on which the competition takes place) and `date` (the date on which the **competition ended** - not necessarily the correct date)|
|`sor_single`,`sor_average` and `sor_combined`|Creates Sum of Ranks tables, and ranks competitors by their sum. As a byproduct, these files also include `world_ranks_single`, `world_ranks_average` and `world_ranks_all`. These create near-clones of the WCA's `ranksaverage` and `rankssingle` tables, but with fields for the competition, round and date which the PB was set at. These also have a `competed` field which is set to 0 if the competitor hasn't competed in the event, if this is indeed 0, the `worldrank` is set to `N + 1`, where `N` is the number of competitors who have succeeded in the event|
