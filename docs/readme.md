Here are various statistics I have computed using the WCA database. These are likely not all up to date, so please message me if you'd like one updated, but bear in mind some of these tables take a while to compute.

* [Best 3x3 Average without a Sub-X Single](bestaveragewithoutsubxsingle.html)
* [Highest Percentage of Best Solves occurring on the Final Solve of an Average](mostbestaslastsolve.html)
* [Most Consecutive Months Competed in](monthstreaks.html)
* [Most Sub-X 3x3 Solves without a Sub-X average](subxsinglewithoutxaverage.html)
* [Sum of the Best Single Times at a Competition](sumbesttimes.html)
