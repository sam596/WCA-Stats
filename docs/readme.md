Here are various statistics I have computed using the WCA database. These are likely not all up to date, so please message me if you'd like one updated, but bear in mind some of these tables take a while to compute.

* [Most Consecutive Months Competed in](/monthstreaks.html)
* [Most Sub-X 3x3 Solves without a Sub-X average](WCA-Stats/subxsinglewithoutxaverage.html)
